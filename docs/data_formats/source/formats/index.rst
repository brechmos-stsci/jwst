Data Format Outline
===================

The data will go through several levels of processing (Levels 1 - 3) as in HST data processing.  The data
formats for levels 1 and 2a are the same for all imaging modes and only diverge at level 2b.  The primary
data formats at level 2b are Imaging and Spectroscopy but the Spectroscopy format has many nuiances
as a function of the instruement and mode.
